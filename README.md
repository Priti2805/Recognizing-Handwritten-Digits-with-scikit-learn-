# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn

Handwritten text recognition has been an issue since the earliest automatic computers were required to distinguish individual characters in handwritten manuscripts.

Python provides a solution for this problem by the use of the package, scikit-learn.

In this ML Analysis, we will be using Support Vector Machine (SVM) Supervised Algorithm to recognize hand written digits from built-in dataset within scikit-learn. We will use the Support Vector Classification (SVC) for this purpose.

This is a basic project for hand written digits recognition model for a virtual internship which I was a part of, and I performed the following tasks:
